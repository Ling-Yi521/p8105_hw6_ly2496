#Problem 2

Uploading the dataset, cleaning, and converting numerical varibles to factors if needed. These variables include babysex, frace, mrace, maform. There is no missing data. 

```{r}
child_df = 
  readr::read_csv("./data/birthweight.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
    mutate(
    babysex = factor(babysex, labels = c("male", "female")),
    frace = factor(frace, levels = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9), labels = c("white", "black", "asian"," puerto_rican", "other", "unknown")),
   mrace = factor(mrace,  c(1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9), labels = c("white", "black", "asian"," puerto rican", "other", "unknown")),
   malform = factor(malform, labels = c("absent", "present"))
     )

sum(is.na(child_df))
```

My proposed hypothesis states that factors affecting a baby's birth-weight includes gestational age in weeks, mother's age at delivery, mothers race, mother's pre-pregnancy BMI, and family income. 

```{r}
fit = lm(bwt~ gaweeks + mrace + momage + ppbmi + fincome, data = child_df)

```

Plotting the predictions and residuals for the above model. 

```{r}
child_df %>%
  add_residuals(fit) %>%
  add_predictions(fit) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = pred, y = resid)) + 
  geom_point()  + 
  geom_smooth(se = TRUE, color = "red") + 
  labs(title = "Predicted vs residuals", 
       x = "Predicted", 
       y = "Residuals")
```

Modeling length at birth and gestational age as predictors (main effects only)

```{r}
fit1 = lm(bwt~ blength + gaweeks, data = child_df)
```

Modeling head circumference, length, sex, and all interactions (including the three-way interactions) between these variables. 

```{r}
fit3 = lm(bwt~ bhead + blength + babysex + bhead*blength + bhead*babysex + blength*babysex + bhead*blength*babysex , data = child_df)
```

Cross validations with crossv_mc

```{r}
cv_child_df = 
  crossv_mc(child_df, 100) 

##make into a tibble

cv_child_df =
  cv_child_df %>% 
  mutate(
    train = map(train, as_tibble),
    test = map(test, as_tibble))
```

Cross-validating prediction accuracy of my model with the other two proposed in the homework. 

```{r}
cv_child_df =
  cv_child_df %>% 
  mutate(
    fit  = map(train, ~lm(bwt~ gaweeks + mrace + momage + ppbmi + fincome, data = .x)),
    fit1 = map(train, ~lm(bwt~ blength + gaweeks, data = .x)),
    fit2 = map(train, ~lm(bwt~ bhead + blength + babysex + bhead*blength + bhead*babysex + blength*babysex + bhead*blength*babysex, data = .x))
    ) %>%
      mutate(
        rmse_fit = map2_dbl(fit, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
        rmse_fit1 = map2_dbl(fit1, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
        rmse_fit2 = map2_dbl(fit2, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y))
        )
```

```{r}
cv_child_df %>% 
  select(starts_with("rmse")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    everything(),
    names_to = "model", 
    values_to = "rmse",
    names_prefix = "rmse") %>% 
  mutate(model = fct_inorder(model)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = model, y = rmse)) + geom_violin()
```
Fit2 (the model with the interactions terms) is the best fit for these variables because it has the lowest foot-meam-square deviation.
